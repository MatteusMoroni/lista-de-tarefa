## Features
âœ… Add new tasks dynamically
âœ… Mark tasks as completed
âœ… Delete tasks when no longer needed
âœ… Save tasks using **Local Storage** to maintain state after page reload
âœ… User-friendly interface with **CSS styling**

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and DOM manipulation
- **Local Storage API** for data persistence

## How It Works
1. The user enters a task and clicks "Add" to save it.
2. Tasks are displayed in a list where each task has a "Complete" and "Delete" option.
3. Clicking "Complete" marks the task as done with a visual indicator.
4. Clicking "Delete" removes the task from the list.
5. All tasks are automatically saved in **Local Storage**, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
